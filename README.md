# Stack-Operations
Stack is a type of array in which we can add a value at top, and also pop the value from top. So, A Stack uses LIFO method i.e. Last-In-First-Out means we can push a value at the top and pop the value which is at first or top of the stack.

This project can perform basic operations on STACK like push(), pop() and display the Current Stack.
So, I am just a beginner that's why I didn't use the Stack Class in it instaed of that I made this project through ArrayList to build some concepts.
You can use this project to understand "How a Stack works?", "How it add a value to the top of Stack?" and "How it pop's the value from Stack?".
It is my first project. So, I am very excited to share with you guys. I hope this will help you to know more about Stack. :)
